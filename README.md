# OwnershipChain
In this project, I have tried to make an application to save user images what user want.
The main purpose to build this application is to give a chance to user to proof their ownership over the thing that image shows with uploaded date and time. Example- Bill, Affidavit etc.
I have done my summer training in React Native and I want to implement my skills into a project.
This is a 2-Members team work project.
This application promote the privacy of the user.
User first register himself to operate the application and then login.
After Login User have to choose the image to store from the gallery.
After the choosen of image user can add a small description of the image so that user can find the image easily.
After uploading the image, user can see their uploaded image with their discription and uploaded date and time.
